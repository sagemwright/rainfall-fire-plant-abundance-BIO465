Use the Reformated-Data files to run the R code provided here. The original data files are available here as well for your reference. Additionally, data may be accessed [here](http://www.aekos.org.au/index.html#/search-results/list/dataset-details-s?datasetId=au.org.aekos.shared.api.model.dataset.SharedSearchResult:115122&q=%5B%7B%22columnNameAekos%22:%22text%22,%22columnNameShared%22:%22text%22,%22operator%22:%22FreeTextBoost%22,%22value%22:%22Simpson%20Desert%22,%22type%22:%22TEXT%22%7D%5D).

The only difference between these files is that in the Reformated-Data files, all of the information is averaged and sorted for simpler data analysis. If use of the original data is desired, the variable names in the R markdown should be fairly simple to understand to receive the same results.

***

An HTML version of the R Markdown is provided so those interested in the analysis process can view the results. For those who are interested in recreating every step of the process, see the .Rmd file as some of the code is not shown in the HMTL version for viewing ease (primarily the code for creating the combined graphs).

The completed report is available for your viewing here as well.
